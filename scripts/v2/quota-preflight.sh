# quota-preflight.sh — runaway brake, not a work limiter.
#
# Every normal lane run starts from an operator merge, so real work is already
# paced by the operator (their decision, 2026-08-26). This only catches
# abnormal volume — a cascade bug burning the subscription window. Over the
# backstop it exits 1, loudly. It never blocks a normal queue.
#
# Counting is per workflow FILE with a server-side filter, so companion runs
# (ci, tripwire) can never crowd lane runs out of the sample. Workflows that
# don't exist yet count as zero — expected until Stack B lands.
#
# Only workflows where a run ALWAYS means the agent actually executed are
# counted: the stage workflows, push-to-main triggered — the ruleset means
# only operator merges can cause those pushes, so their runs are never skips.
# Everything else is deliberately NOT counted (Codex cloud review of #131):
# review-on-pr (fork PRs skip), fix-on-review (plain comments skip), and the
# dispatch-only plumbing probe (non-operator dispatch skips) all create
# cost-free skipped runs, so counting them would let noise — or deliberate
# spam — trip the brake and block real work. Their genuine volume is bounded
# elsewhere: every real review/fix cycle starts from a counted stage run or an
# operator push, round labels cap the fix loop, and the probe is manual.
#
#   YSTACK_RUN_BACKSTOP    runs allowed per window (default 20)
#   YSTACK_RUN_WINDOW_H    window in hours (default 5)

#
# The legacy FABRICA_* names still work as fallbacks, so targets that have not
# renamed yet keep working. When both names are set, YSTACK_* wins.
#
