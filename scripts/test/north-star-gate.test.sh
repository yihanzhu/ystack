# north-star-gate.test.sh — integration asserts for the ATOMIC per-target north-star flip
# (issue #98a): the manager-review.sh consensus GATE and doctor.sh check (h) both read the
# TARGET's north star, and the gate reads it COMMITTED (never an uncommitted working-tree edit).
# (Seeding a target's .ystack/north-star.md is adoption scope — deferred to #98b — so this
# suite no longer drives setup-target-repo.sh.)
#
# The ystack rename (this PR) keeps old targets working. The (23*) cases prove the fallbacks:
# the gate still reads a legacy `.fabrica/north-star.md`, still FAILs on the legacy
# `fabrica-shipped-default` marker, prefers the canonical `.ystack/` star when both exist,
# honors the legacy FABRICA_ALLOW_LOCAL_MIRROR env var as an alias for
# YSTACK_ALLOW_LOCAL_MIRROR, and still applies (and limits) a legacy `.fabrica/models.conf`
# override with FABRICA_* keys.
#
# These complement scripts/test/north-star-resolver.test.sh, which asserts the resolver lib in
# isolation. This suite asserts the CONSUMERS now wired to that resolver by #98a — the part
# #99 deliberately left dormant.
#
# The gate (manager-review.sh) requires `gh` and `codex`, and materializes a detached worktree
# with REAL git. So we run the REAL script end-to-end against throwaway REAL git repos with
# `gh` and `codex` STUBBED on PATH — testing the actual pinned committed-read code path, not a
# reimplementation of it. The safety-critical assertions (from the manager-debate GAP) are the
# COMMITTED-vs-uncommitted pair, in BOTH directions:
#   - a worktree-only .ystack/north-star.md (not committed) does NOT authorize (gate FAILs); and
#   - a HEAD-committed star STILL authorizes even if the working-tree copy is deleted or modified.
# Plus: LOCAL committed star → debates; LOCAL + shipped-default marker → FAIL; UNSET → FAIL;
# doctor UNSET → WARN and doctor LOCAL committed → pass; and the SOURCE-IDENTITY assert
# (approval source == gate source), pinned by inspecting the shipped files since operator
# approval is not machine-readable.
#
# OFFLINE and hermetic: no network/gh/codex — both are faked on PATH. Every case builds a
# throwaway git repo in a temp dir. Run: scripts/test/north-star-gate.test.sh

# --- fake gh / codex on PATH -------------------------------------------------------
# Fake gh: the identity that the #102 gh-bound anchor pattern needs.
#   - `repo view [<repo>] --json nameWithOwner` → a slug keyed off the CWD's git top-level
#     basename (`someone/<basename>`), so a throwaway target repo and the real ystack clone get
#     DIFFERENT slugs (the resolver's ystack-self check must not false-match).
#   - `repo view [<repo>] --json url` → the matching web URL `https://github.com/someone/<basename>`
#     (#102). ghr_gh_repo_id reads the HOST off this url and re-appends the slug, so the gate's
#     canonical identity is `github.com/someone/<basename>` — which the remote-backed target's
#     configured `origin` url (`https://github.com/someone/<basename>.git`) normalizes to, so
#     ghr_select_remote matches `origin`. (The FETCH goes to the bare repo via an insteadOf
#     transport rewrite; identity matches on the CONFIGURED url — see setup_remote below.)
#   - `FAKE_GH_NO_REPO=1` in the env → `repo view` fails (empty), simulating a genuinely local /
#     no-gh-remote target so manager-review takes its VISIBLE local-HEAD fallback (and doctor its
#     visible fallback). Used by the greenfield/local-only case.
#   - `issue view` prints deterministic scalars for gh's -q extraction; `issue comment` is a no-op.

# --- remote-backed throwaway targets (#102) ----------------------------------------
# The #102 gate anchors to the gh-BOUND remote's DEFAULT branch, FETCHED FRESH. So a throwaway
# target must have a matching configured remote AND a fetchable default branch. We wire that
# HERMETICALLY (no network):
#   - a bare "remote" repo lives under $tmproot/remotes/<name>.git;
#   - the working repo's `origin` is CONFIGURED with the clean identity url
#     `https://github.com/someone/<name>.git` (what ghr_select_remote matches against — it reads
#     the CONFIGURED url, ignoring insteadOf);
#   - an `insteadOf` rewrite maps that https url to the local bare repo, so the actual git
#     TRANSPORT (push/fetch) goes to the bare repo offline;
#   - `git remote set-head origin --auto` populates refs/remotes/origin/HEAD so
#     ghr_remote_default_branch can name the default branch.
# The default branch is `main`. Commits are PUSHED to the bare repo so the fetched default carries
# them — that is exactly the integrated state the gate anchors to.

# (23) RENAME FALLBACKS — targets still on the LEGACY names must keep working end-to-end.
# The product rename moved the per-target star to `.ystack/north-star.md`, the marker to
# `ystack-shipped-default`, the opt-in env var to YSTACK_ALLOW_LOCAL_MIRROR, and the per-target
# override to `.ystack/models.conf` with YSTACK_* keys. Old targets still carry the `.fabrica/`
# paths, the `fabrica-shipped-default` marker, and FABRICA_* keys — each case below proves the
# legacy form still behaves exactly like the canonical one (same authorizations, same FAILs,
# same guards), and that the canonical form wins when both are present.
