# doctor.sh — read-only restore self-check for ystack.
#
# RESTORE.md only proves a rebuild by running a full live loop; this answers the
# faster question "is the team reconstructable from HERE?" — a restorer can have
# every file back yet still be blocked on a missing credential, an uninstalled
# /yshifu command, or absent loop labels. doctor surfaces those gaps in seconds.
#
# Beyond presence/PATH it also probes whether the setup actually WORKS for a real
# run, so a green doctor can't overstate readiness: it verifies Codex is signed in
# (not merely on PATH), warns when the TARGET's north star (resolved via the shared
# resolver — the target's .ystack/north-star.md, with the legacy .fabrica/north-star.md
# honored as a fallback, or the control-plane NORTH_STAR.md
# on a ystack-self run) is unset or still the shipped default, and — in
# the target-repo path — checks the target has PR-triggered CI (the hard merge gate)
# and reports (advisory only) whether a CLAUDE.md "Stack & commands" override is
# present (commands are auto-discovered, so it is optional). It also statically
# validates the model-tiering config (config/models.conf, #109) and warns on an
# environment override that would silently bypass it.
#
# It is STRICTLY READ-ONLY: it never creates, edits, or deletes anything (and the
# optional label check delegates to setup-target-repo.sh's --check mode, which is
# itself read-only). Every check prints a single `pass:`/`warn:`/`fail:` line.
#
# WARN vs FAIL: a `fail:` is a real blocker and makes doctor exit non-zero (so it
# stays usable as a CI/pre-flight gate); a `warn:` flags a likely-wrong-but-not-
# blocking condition (e.g. an unreplaced north star) and does NOT by itself change
# the exit code. doctor exits non-zero ONLY when at least one check failed.
#
# Checks:
#   (a) ~/.claude/commands/yshifu.md exists AND contains THIS clone's resolved
#       control-plane path — i.e. /yshifu points at this clone (same path
#       derivation install.sh uses).
#   (b) gh is present and authenticated.
#   (c) claude (Claude Code CLI) is on PATH — the team runs in a Claude Code session.
#   (d) codex is on PATH AND signed in (auth probed via `codex login status` when that
#       subcommand exists; degrades to a PATH-only pass with a note if it doesn't).
#   (e) jq is on PATH — required by scripts/merge-pr.sh to parse gh's CI-check JSON.
#   (f) every file in ci/required-files.txt is present on disk (the manifest is
#       read live — the list is never duplicated here).
#   (h) the TARGET's north star (resolved via scripts/lib/north-star.sh from the cwd —
#       consistent with the manager-review.sh gate) is set and its ACTIVE entry is not
#       still the shipped default (WARN). Detected by a stable MARKER
#       (`<!-- ystack-shipped-default -->`; the legacy `<!-- fabrica-shipped-default -->`
#       counts too) on the active-entry heading line, NOT a
#       north-star phrase — so no transition needs a doctor edit (the marker rides to the
#       new default; adopters remove it when they set their own star) and the whole-file doc
#       mentions of the token never false-warn. UNSET (non-empty target, no committed star),
#       EMPTY (commit-less), and NOREPO all WARN (not FAIL) — the gate FAILs, doctor only
#       diagnoses. Also WARNs if there is no `status: active` entry (a malformed file). doctor
#       reads the WORKING-TREE copy (diagnostic) and NOTES if it differs from HEAD, since the
#       gate reads committed state. When a target arg is given, the local read is attributed
#       only if the cwd's slug matches it (else WARN that it wasn't checked). ADDITIONALLY (a
#       second, independent signal), (h) reads the resolved target root's on-disk
#       `.ystack/install-record.json` — the record packaging/v1's installer writes — and WARNs
#       when it reports `north_star.state: "placeholder-unset"` (the installer's own record that
#       the target still carries its untouched placeholder, which itself has no `status: active`
#       entry for the marker check above to anchor on), or WARNs (never crashes) when the record
#       is present but malformed. Degrades to a regex-based read when `jq` is not on PATH.
#   (g) optional <owner>/<repo> arg → delegate to setup-target-repo.sh --check to
#       verify the loop labels exist and match.
#   (i) [target-repo path] the target has PR-triggered CI (the hard merge gate).
#       Detected from the OBSERVED checks on RECENTLY-UPDATED PRs (ground truth): check-runs
#       / commit statuses on a recent PR's HEAD. This covers GitHub Actions AND external
#       CI (CircleCI/Buildkite/Jenkins) uniformly — anything that posts a check on a PR
#       head — with no false pass from disabled/inactive workflow files. It is
#       PR-SPECIFIC: a repo whose CI runs only on pushes to the default branch — never on
#       PRs — has no gate for merge-pr.sh, so doctor must NOT count default-branch checks.
#       It is also RECENCY-SCOPED: only PRs updated within the last ~90 days count, so a
#       repo that HAD CI but since removed it (old closed PRs still carry check-runs) no
#       longer false-passes on those stale historical checks. No checks (or no recent PRs)
#       → WARN, not FAIL: merge-pr.sh's `gh pr checks` is the real enforcement, so doctor
#       flags the risk rather than hard-failing a valid external-CI repo (or one with no
#       recent PRs). Enumerating *active* Actions workflows via the Actions API is a
#       deferred enhancement (a follow-up issue).
#   (j) [target-repo path] ADVISORY: whether the target has a filled-in CLAUDE.md
#       "Stack & commands" override (exists, no `<cmd>` placeholders, AND has the section).
#       Informational only — the coder auto-discovers install/test/build commands from the
#       repo's CI workflows and standard manifests, so a CLAUDE.md is an OPTIONAL override
#       (pin/disambiguate a non-standard toolchain), NOT a prerequisite. WARN flags its
#       absence/placeholders as a heads-up, never as a blocker.
#   (k) config/models.conf (#109's shipped model-tiering defaults) is present and
#       SOURCEABLE, and — once sourced — YSTACK_CODER_MODEL / YSTACK_HANDS_MODEL are
#       non-empty. STATIC only: this is doctor's own diagnostic sourcing (isolated to a
#       subshell), never a live model/API call, and it does NOT read a target's optional
#       per-target `.ystack/models.conf` override (that convention is documented, not
#       enforced by any code yet — see README.md's "Model policy" section).
#   (l) WARN if `CLAUDE_CODE_SUBAGENT_MODEL` is set in doctor's own environment — that
#       env var would silently override any per-spawn model argument once coder spawning
#       is wired to config/models.conf (issue #110), so a stray export is worth flagging
#       early even though nothing reads it yet.

# (h) the TARGET's north star is set and not still the shipped default -------------
# Consistent with the manager-review.sh gate (#98a), doctor resolves the north star FOR THE
# TARGET via the shared resolver (scripts/lib/north-star.sh) from the cwd's checkout: the
# target's own `.ystack/north-star.md` (LOCAL; the legacy `.fabrica/north-star.md` still counts
# as a fallback), or the control-plane root NORTH_STAR.md on a
# ystack-self run (YSTACK_SELF). If it aims at the shipped default (never
# replaced), the gate would debate proposals against the wrong goal. WARN (not FAIL): a stale
# or unset north star doesn't block restore, but it must be set + replaced before proactive
# mode is meaningful for the adopter's repo. UNSET (a non-empty target with no committed star)
# is likewise a WARN, matching the gate's autonomy-authorization gap without hard-failing
# restore. The gate FAILs on these — doctor only diagnoses.
#
# DIAGNOSTIC read of the WORKING-TREE copy: unlike the gate (which reads COMMITTED state at a
# pinned commit — an uncommitted edit must not authorize proactive work), doctor is a
# read-only self-check, so reading the on-disk file is acceptable; it additionally NOTES when
# the working-tree copy differs from HEAD, so an operator sees an uncommitted edit that the
# gate would ignore.
#
# Detection is MARKER-BASED, not phrase-based, and SCOPED to the ACTIVE ENTRY, via the SHARED
# helper ns_has_shipped_default_marker (so doctor and the gate never disagree on what counts as
# an un-replaced placeholder). The shipped-default entry carries a stable marker —
# `ystack-shipped-default` (as an HTML comment; the legacy `fabrica-shipped-default` marker is
# matched too) — on the active-entry heading, so a north-star
# transition never needs a matching edit here (the transition carries the marker onto the new
# active/shipped-default entry), and an adopter who sets their own star REMOVES the marker and the
# warning clears. Scoping to the active-entry region keeps the mechanism clearable: NORTH_STAR.md /
# the template also NAME the token in prose, so a whole-file bare-token grep would warn forever;
# the helper's whitespace/case-insensitive match also catches a spacing/casing/reflow-split marker
# variant. We also WARN when there is no `status: active` entry at all (a malformed/active-less
# file) — an independent readiness gap.
#
# SECOND, INDEPENDENT SOURCE — the installer's install-record.json (roadmap item 10): the marker
# check above can only WARN on the shipped placeholder when there's a `status: active` entry to
# scope onto, but packaging/v1/install.sh's north-star.md placeholder has NO active entry at all
# (see its comment block) — a target that installed and never touched it falls through to the
# generic "no active entry" / UNSET branches below, which don't name the installer's placeholder
# specifically. So, after the marker-based verdict above, (h) ALSO reads the resolved target
# root's on-disk `<toplevel>/.ystack/install-record.json` (NOT committed state — this file is the
# installer's own on-disk record, not something the north-star gate reads) and WARNs when its
# `.body.north_star.state` is `"placeholder-unset"`. A record that isn't a regular, non-symlink,
# <=64 KiB file holding exactly one JSON text also WARNs (a distinct "malformed" message) rather
# than crashing; any other state — or no record at all — adds nothing. Parsing prefers `jq` (as
# check (e) already probes for) and degrades to a scoped regex read when `jq` is not on PATH, so
# this diagnostic never hard-depends on it. Only checked when the cwd IS the target being asked
# about (same `ns_h_cwd_is_target` guard the anchor-resolution block above uses), so a mismatched
# target arg never has some OTHER repo's install record misattributed to it.
#
# (#98a) doctor (h) now diagnoses the SAME COMMITTED source the gate authorizes on — for a LOCAL
# target, `HEAD:.ystack/north-star.md` (falling back to the legacy `HEAD:.fabrica/north-star.md`
# when the new path is absent, matching the gate); for a ystack-self run, `HEAD:NORTH_STAR.md` —
# read via `git show`. Previously it read the WORKING-TREE copy, so it could disagree with the gate on a
# committed-but-worktree-modified/deleted star. The working-tree copy is now only a SUPPLEMENTARY
# note (does it differ from / is it committed at HEAD?). UNSET/EMPTY/NOREPO still WARN.

# FIX D — if the resolver lib could not be sourced (a partial restore where
# scripts/lib/north-star.sh is exactly what's missing), (h) cannot run its resolver-backed logic.
# Report it as a FAIL line here (check (f) independently flags it in the manifest) and skip the

# ANCHOR RESOLUTION (#102; READ-ONLY in doctor, round-5 [P2]) — doctor is STRICTLY read-only, so
# unlike the GATE it must NEVER `git fetch` (a fetch writes .git/FETCH_HEAD and downloads objects —
# mutating the checkout for a command documented as read-only). doctor therefore diagnoses against
# the LOCAL COMMITTED state already present, using only READ-ONLY probes to name the default branch:
#   - the default-branch NAME comes from gh (`gh repo view --json defaultBranchRef`) or, offline, the
#     remote's advertised HEAD (`git ls-remote --symref`) / the local remote-tracking symref — all
#     read-only (ghr_gh_default_branch / ghr_remote_default_branch; no fetch);
#   - the NORTH STAR is read from the LOCAL committed state: the local default-branch ref
#     `refs/heads/<default>` when it exists, else local HEAD.
# This is ADVISORY: the GATE (manager-review.sh) anchors to the freshly-FETCHED remote default at run
# time, so a local ref that lags the remote can make doctor's read differ from the gate's. The anchor
# line below names doctor's local source AND states the gate fetches fresh, so the read is never
# mistaken for the gate's authoritative anchor. `anchor_commit` is the commit-ish the committed reads
# below resolve against (a local branch ref or `HEAD`). The gh-bound-fallback WARN semantics

# (i) target repo has PR-triggered CI (the hard merge gate) -----------------------
# A green doctor on a real repo must not mean "no hard gate." But the gate that's
# actually enforced is merge-pr.sh's `gh pr checks`, which surfaces ANY PR check —
# GitHub Actions AND external CI (CircleCI/Buildkite/Jenkins) wired in as required
# status checks. If none is detectable we WARN (not FAIL) — the merge gate is the
# real enforcement, so doctor flags the risk (confirm the repo runs checks on PRs)
# rather than blocking a setup that may be fine (external CI, or CI that hasn't run yet).
#
# We detect via the OBSERVED checks on recent PRs (ground truth), not by scanning
# workflow files. Reading `.github/workflows` for a `pull_request` trigger is a
# heuristic with an endless tail of edge cases — disabled/ignored files (`ci.yml.disabled`),
# `.github/workflows` listing non-active YAML, format variants — and it false-passes when
# an inactive workflow merely mentions the trigger. Observed PR checks have no such
# false pass: a disabled workflow produces no checks. This signal covers GitHub Actions
# AND external CI uniformly (anything that posts a check-run/status on a PR head).
#
# It must be PR-specific: probing the default branch's HEAD would false-pass a repo
# whose CI runs only on pushes to the default branch and NOT on PRs — exactly the repo
# with no gate for merge-pr.sh. So we list recent PRs and inspect the head SHA of each
# that has one, stopping at the first with any check-run/status. We tolerate the API
# calls' error/empty cases (no PRs, no checks, 404, 403) without aborting under `set -e`
# (each call is `|| true`, defaulting the count to 0); the PR list is buffered into a
# variable and looped via a here-string (no `… | grep` pipe).
#
# It must ALSO be recency-scoped (issue #66): counting check-runs across ALL PRs
# (`--state all`) false-passes a repo that HAD CI but since removed it — old closed PRs
# still carry historical check-runs, overstating readiness. So we restrict the signal to
# PRs updated within a RECENCY WINDOW (90 days — long enough to cover a repo with slow but
# real PR activity, short enough that CI removed months ago no longer counts) by asking
# `gh pr list` for each PR's `updatedAt` and skipping any older than the cutoff. Ancient
# checks from since-removed CI therefore no longer register as "PR CI present." If nothing
# recent qualifies we fall through to the same WARN (no hard FAIL) as before.
#
# DEFERRED ENHANCEMENT (follow-up issue): enumerating the *active* Actions workflows via
# the Actions API (`repos/<repo>/actions/workflows`, which reports each workflow's
# state) would let doctor pass a freshly-set-up repo that has a valid PR workflow but no
# PRs yet — without re-introducing the file-scan's false passes.

  # slow-but-real PR activity against not honoring CI that was removed months ago. The
  # cutoff comparison runs inside jq (fromdateiso8601 vs now - window) to stay portable
  # across BSD/GNU `date`.
  #
  # ORDER BY UPDATED TIME BEFORE LIMITING: `gh pr list` defaults to ordering by CREATION
  # time, so `--limit 5` alone fetches the 5 newest-CREATED PRs. A long-lived PR updated
  # within the window (and showing CI) but with >5 newer-created PRs would then never enter
  # the fetched set, and the recency filter would wrongly report "no recent PR-triggered CI."

# wire it up), so doctor sourcing it here is purely diagnostic, same as any other
# presence/shape check in this script.
#
# "Sourceable" is verified by actually sourcing it, isolated inside a command
# substitution's own subshell so a syntax error can't abort doctor under `set -e`
# and sourcing it repeatedly across doctor runs never leaks vars into THIS shell.
# We resolve it at the fixed control-plane path ($repo_root/config/models.conf) —
# this is the shipped-defaults file, not a per-target one, so it is the same
# regardless of any <owner>/<repo> target arg.
#
# We deliberately do NOT read a target's optional per-target `.ystack/models.conf`
# override here: that convention (same format/keys, sourced after these defaults) is
# documented in README.md's "Model policy" section but not enforced by any code in
# this PR, doctor included.

# individual subagent spawn once the coder spawn is wired to config/models.conf
# (#110) — defeating the fixed-ceiling-by-design guarantee without any visible
# error. Nothing reads config/models.conf yet, so this can't actually misbehave
# today; it's an early heads-up so the env is clean before that wiring lands.
